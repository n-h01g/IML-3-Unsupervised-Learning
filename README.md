<h2 align="center">Project III: Unsupervised Learning<br></h2>
<p align="center">Used unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers and use those similarities to segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques. This segmentation is used to help the business make more informed marketing and product decisions.</p>

### Project Details

In this project, I: 
- explored the datasets and considered the level of measurement for each feature in the dataset (e.g. categorical, ordinal, numeric);
- assessed missing data and created solutions to create a usable dataset;
- used dimensionality reduction techniques, including feature scaling and principal component analysis, to identify relationships between variables in the dataset; and
- applied clustering techniques (k-means method) to identify groups in the general demographic data and to the customers dataset to see how market segments differ between the general population and the mail-order sales company.
